# streamplace overlay thing

Uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) but you could probably also just use yarn or npm or whatever.

edit config variables in server.js and script.js

`bun run server.js` to run the server application

do something like `npx http-server` in this folder to run the overlay

add localhost:8081/index.html or whatever port it's on as a browser source

congratulations. overlay achieved
